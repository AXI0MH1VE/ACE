# AxiomHive Launch Roadmap (90 days)

- Weeks 1-2: Scaffold Rust core, REST API, and Tauri shell; stub EZKL/Halo2 integration; baseline Lightning billing.
- Weeks 3-4: Implement hybrid-block training/inference glue; WASM build with wasm-bindgen + SIMD; sliding-window/global attention tuning.
- Weeks 5-6: DAG sharding + Merkle checkpoints; libp2p gossip for peer discovery; chunked proof-of-workload receipts.
- Weeks 7-8: Verified mode hardening—Lean4 axiom loader, EZKL proof generation path, C=0 signing, replay protection.
- Weeks 9-10: Multi-modal adapters (image/audio/pdf); quantized weights (4-8 bit) for mobile/edge; CUDA fast-path on desktop/server.
- Weeks 11-12: UX polish (Creative Studio + Proof Explorer), one-click installers, pay-per-proof Lightning flows, telemetry opt-in.
- Weeks 13+: Compliance packs (finance/legal/health), adversarial red-team harness, long-context benchmarks, marketplace for axiom sets.
