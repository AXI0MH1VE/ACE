# ACE Platform Overview

ACE combines three key elements: creator-led programmable IP, cryptographically auditable AI, and Bitcoin payments to fundamentally change software economics. The platform shifts toward creator-controlled business models rather than traditional subscription and payment processor ecosystems.

## Bitcoin Lightning Paywall Architecture
- ACE exclusively uses Bitcoin Lightning microtransactions for access, rejecting subscriptions and credit cards.
- The system runs its own Lightning paywall infrastructure rather than routing payments through third-party processors (Stripe/PayPal).
- Direct payment flow from user wallet to creator wallet with instant final settlement—no intermediaries.

## Creator Economic Control and Value Chain
- The creator (Alexis Adams/AxiomHive) maintains total control over the value chain via direct payment routing to their wallet.
- Unlike most Bitcoin implementations that convert to fiat through intermediaries, ACE keeps payments in native Bitcoin/Lightning.
- Removes central points of friction, fees, and rule-imposition from traditional payment processors.
- Censorship-resistant: payment processors cannot block or interfere with the creator’s revenue stream.

## Integration of Product and Payment
- ACE integrates the AI product and payment infrastructure as a unified system.
- Authenticated intelligence is paired directly with monetization—“ACE is the business and the AI.”
- Users retain self-sovereign payment; creators retain self-sovereign receipt.

## Strategic Implications
- Connects technical trust (cryptographic auditability) with economic transparency.
- Expands creator economics while intentionally requiring Bitcoin/Lightning access.
- Positions ACE as a future-ready monetization architecture for the coming decade.
