# ACE Platform Overview

ACE combines three key elements: creator-led programmable IP, cryptographically auditable AI, and Bitcoin payments to fundamentally change software economics. The platform shifts toward creator-controlled business models rather than traditional subscription and payment processor ecosystems.

## Bitcoin Lightning Paywall Architecture
- ACE exclusively uses Bitcoin Lightning microtransactions for access, rejecting subscriptions and credit cards.
- The system runs its own Lightning paywall infrastructure rather than routing payments through third-party processors (Stripe/PayPal).
- Direct payment flow from user wallet to creator wallet with instant final settlement—no intermediaries.

## Creator Economic Control and Value Chain
- The creator (Alexis Adams/AxiomHive) maintains total control over the value chain via direct payment routing to their wallet.
- Unlike most Bitcoin implementations that convert to fiat through intermediaries, ACE keeps payments in native Bitcoin/Lightning.
- Removes central points of friction, fees, and rule-imposition from traditional payment processors.
- Censorship-resistant: payment processors cannot block or interfere with the creator’s revenue stream.

## Integration of Product and Payment
- ACE integrates the AI product and payment infrastructure as a unified system.
- Authenticated intelligence is paired directly with monetization—“ACE is the business and the AI.”
- Users retain self-sovereign payment; creators retain self-sovereign receipt.

## Strategic Implications
- Connects technical trust (cryptographic auditability) with economic transparency.
- Expands creator economics while intentionally requiring Bitcoin/Lightning access.
- Positions ACE as a future-ready monetization architecture for the coming decade.

## Axiom Hive Core Technology Proposition
- Programmable trust-grade AI built on cryptographic proof and verifiable security axioms.
- Outputs are cryptographically signed and labeled CEVO Zero; users receive verified truth with built-in auditing.
- Zero-knowledge proofs let auditors confirm rules were followed without exposing proprietary model data, removing the black-box element and enabling trustless licensing.
- CEVO Zero: zero bias claims, zero proprietary training lock-in, verifiably clean provenance; verified truth carries higher value than standard digital media.

## AI Sovereignty (Edge + WASM)
- Edge-native and WASM-optimized for compact, portable deployments on laptops, browser tabs, and Raspberry Pi.
- Avoids centralized cloud lock-in; restores user sovereignty and control over compute and data paths.

## Bitcoin Lightning as Strategic Differentiator
- Lightning-only payments; no subscriptions or cards; immediate settlement.
- Deliberate high initial friction (onboarding may exclude ~90% of casual users) in exchange for alignment and censorship resistance.
- Once onboarded, near-zero marginal friction: microtransactions can gate every interaction/proof request; no processor negotiations or cross-border hurdles.
- Lightning costs are minimal, enabling granular per-proof monetization unlike subscription/card models where fees can exceed payment amounts.

## Strategic Positioning
- High friction is “only high once” during onboarding; afterward, interactions are fluid and trustless.
- Combines verifiable AI architecture (cryptographic proofs, CEVO Zero) with Bitcoin-native monetization for a differentiated, creator-led business model.
